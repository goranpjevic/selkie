  - set the '$SELKIE_KEY_FILE' environment variable to the file containing the
    key for 'selkie' to encrypt and decrypt entries.
    default location:  '$HOME/.local/etc/selkie/key_file'

notes:

  - 'openssl' must be installed for 'selkie' to work.

  - all entries stored by 'selkie' are made up of an entry name, username, and
    password.

  - the key used by 'selkie' to encrypt and decrypt entries can be passed with
    the '-k' option or added to the key file.
